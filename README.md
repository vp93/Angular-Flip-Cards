A sleek delivery card concept made with Angular. The cards deal with a whole workflow, rather than just any isolated interaction : starting from selecting a delivery item, 
to viewing stats about that item, to placing an order and then tracking the same order , all through the same interface. Each card corresponds to a unique delivery item, 
and each card should contain unique (update) information about the delivery in question.
